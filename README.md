- Introduction: In this assignment, each team must produce an interactive story using the following title - A day in the life of ___. To create a user-driven experience, we designed a game inspired by Florence (a well-known interactive story and video game). Players will experience a day in a girl's life and face some difficult times in her life. Several interactive mechanisms help players get into the game, including clickable items, scratch-off images, and sliding scenes.

# Notable Contributions
1. Designed and implemented interactive mechanisms (clickable items, scratch-off effect, zoom-in/out animation, etc)
2. Brainstormed storylines and characterize the personality of our character with other team members
3. Strengthen the playing experience by adding background music and SFX
